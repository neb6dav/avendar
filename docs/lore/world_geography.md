# Avendar: World Geography

Avendar is a massive and unique world within a strange and hostile multiverse. The Prime Material plane — where most of the game's action takes place — contains diverse regions, city-states, and landmarks shaped by millennia of racial conflict and divine intervention.

---

## The Prime Material

The world of Avendar itself exists within what is called the **Prime Material plane**. Beyond the Prime lies the broader multiverse, including:

- **The Nightmare Realm** — Serachel's prison
- **The Silver Veil** — The barrier between the Prime and the demonic planes; Void scholars pierce it in summoning rituals
- **Demonic Planes** — Source of the demons that Void scholars summon
- **The ch'taren's destroyed home plane** — Consumed by Tzet-Askhari, beyond the scope of the Compact

The Prime Material is governed by **The Compact** — the ancient agreement by which the Overgods agreed not to directly manifest on the Prime, preventing divine war from destroying the world.

## Major City-States

The collapse of the Republic of Earendam following the Kankoran wars gave rise to the independent city-states that define the modern political landscape.

### Earendam

**"Earendam the Grand"**

The largest and most powerful human city-state, Earendam sits in the **Earendam river basin** (also called the Dantaron river valley). It is the cultural and political heart of human civilization on the Prime Material.

**Key facts:**
- Founded (or first led to prominence) by **Corvandil Lyceonis**, first Patrician of Earendam, who is revered as a Saint among the Brotherhood for his legendary defense of the city during the First Kankoran War
- The month of **Lyceonis** in the Avendar calendar is named after him
- Once served as the center of the **Republic**, the dominant pre-collapse human empire
- Though buying and selling of slaves within Earendam's territories is outlawed, shuddeni lobbying has ensured that slaves brought in from without remain legal
- Home to the great **Temple of Qalnistra** — among the most famed houses of worship in Avendar, where the legendary priestess Falcia Nilin held court
- The religion of Rystaia is well-tolerated in Earendam despite Her opposition to Iandiric law
- Players may roleplay as **Earendamian nobles** — the game places no restrictions on in-setting roles of origin

**Historical significance:**
- Repeatedly attacked during the War of Fire (Sythraki srryn ravaged the Earendam river valley)
- Survived the collapse of the Republic
- Remains the primary hub for human activity, trade, politics, and adventuring

### Var Bandor

A major city-state connected by trade routes to Kohlis and other nefortu settlements. Kohlis established trade relationships with Var Bandor and a multitude of smaller settlements, making it one of the key economic hubs of the modern era.

---

### Kohlis

The primary **nefortu** city-state, founded under the sign of **Ayaunj's** sacred amber dragon on the principles the goddess espoused. The nefortu developed Kohlis as a center of commerce, establishing themselves as some of the preeminent merchants and traders of the continent.

Kohlis flourished through trade connections with nearby Var Bandor and smaller human and ethron settlements.

---

### Rahh-Nefor

Another nefortu settlement. Ayaunj is little-liked in Rahh-Nefor, hearkening back to a centuries-old rift between Her and **Tzajai**.

---

### Ch'taren Havens

The three ch'taren havens represent the primary settlements of the ch'taren race on the Prime Material, founded after the ch'taren's arrival during the War of Night:

- **Ad'mastaesia** — The original haven; construction required displacing srryn and alatharya natives. It was overrun by a combined force of shuddeni and srryn not long after its founding and is now home only to ghosts and memories.

- **Jh'ten** — Has closed itself away after an attempt to disease its people. Largely inaccessible to outsiders.

- **Avayn** — Long been insular, with only rare traders and ambassadors emerging.

---

### Ashta Harrud

Once a fertile and prosperous civilization, Ashta Harrud was devastated during the **War of Fire** by Bayyal's nefortu forces. It is referenced primarily as a historical loss — a civilization destroyed in the fires of elemental war.

---

### Tisroc

A new chaja settlement of mixed free and formerly enslaved chaja, located south of Earendam. It was razed just after the War of Fire — a tragedy that set back the chaja's push for freedom by generations.

---

### Jindaska

The village of the **caladaran** race. Jindaska breathes the spirit of the caladaran with all the quests and inhabitants appropriate to their culture. It serves as the cultural and spiritual heart of caladaran civilization on the Prime.

---

## Major Geographical Regions

### The Sythtys Swamps

The ancestral homeland of the **srryn**. The saurian race still resides within these swamps, their lifestyle crude and not developed far beyond their earliest days. While some srryn have moved away from the swamps to join the cities and guilds of the world, many still cling to their ancient lifestyle.

The Sythtys swamps are closely associated with **Sythrak**, the Saurian Lord, whose divine portfolio encompasses swamps and wetlands.

---

### Daphoa

The homeland of the **aelin**, Daphoa was one of the great civilizations of the post-Sundering world. The goddess **Alil** dwelt atop the Daphoan **Ialiedae mountains**, and it was here that the aelin received their emblematic wings.

During the War of Fire:
- The Sythraki army's arrival in Daphoa truly imperiled aelin survival
- Alil destroyed all life in the southern province of **Illata** in a conflagration of light and fire, in defiance of Aeoleri's inaction
- The Aeolians (followers of Aeoleri) were driven to the fringes of Daphoan society
- The **Dalae era** followed, characterized by expanded roles for women and dismissal of traditional Aeolian prohibitions

---

### The Brintors

A mountain/highland region referenced in multiple historical contexts:
- Home to aelin strongholds that were attacked during the War of Fire
- Site of Marlax's near-genocidal anti-chaja campaign, which destroyed multiple chaja cities
- The alatharya maintained sanctuaries scattered across the Brintors following the Sundering

---

### The Mlejin Range

Another mountain range where post-Sundering alatharya maintained sanctuaries. Referenced as one of three areas where the alatharya huddled in the wake of their fall (along with the Brintors and the Rirro Jagka).

---

### The Rirro Jagka

A third region where alatharya maintained sanctuaries during the dark centuries following the Sundering.

---

### The Crimson Sands

A desert region — ancient texts suggest that alatharya fought Bayyal's followers during the march across what is now the Crimson Sands, though their role in the War of Fire conflict is largely unknown.

---

### The Earendam River Basin / Dantaron River Valley

The heartland of human civilization. Named in cautionary tales passed down through generations, the Dantaron river valley was the site of repeated attacks during the War of Fire. The **Republic of Earendam** was centered here, and its successor city-state of Earendam remains the dominant human power.

---

## The Multiverse

### The School of Heroes

All player characters are adventurers who have graduated from the **School of Heroes**. It is here that new characters learn the basics of Avendar's world, including access to *The Races of Avendar* by Antaerus the Elder. The School of Heroes accepts those of any background — from simple farmboys to Harrudim princesses.

### Planes of Existence

Beyond the Prime Material, the Avendar multiverse includes multiple planes that scholars and Void mages interact with:

- **Planar spheres** — Each elemental sphere has associated planes from which magic is drawn
- **The demonic planes** — Source of the demons that Void scholars summon through the Silver Veil
- **The Silver Veil** — The barrier pierced by Void summoning rituals
- **The Nightmare Realm** — Serachel's current prison
