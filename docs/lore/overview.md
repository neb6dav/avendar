# Avendar: The Crucible of Legends — World Overview

## What is Avendar?

Avendar: The Crucible of Legends is a text-based Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) based on the DikuMUD game engine. First opened to the public in **1998**, it is a persistent online multiplayer RPG — imagine a tabletop roleplaying game that players can drop into whenever they like, where mechanics are adjudicated automatically and GameMasters facilitate interaction and tell stories.

Avendar is a fully original fantasy world with its own unique history, classes, areas, races, and code. Its world history has evolved and developed organically over more than 25 years of life, resonating in every facet of an elaborate and detailed game world.

## Core Identity

In MUD parlance, Avendar is an **RP+/PvP+ MUD**, meaning it encourages and enforces rules supporting both roleplaying and player-vs-player combat.

- **Roleplaying is required.** Any time you are logged in, you are expected to remain in-character and respond to things as a character within the setting of Avendar would.
- **PvP is integral.** Avendar uses inter-character combat as a method for in-game conflict resolution and as an enhancement to roleplay.
- **The world is dynamic.** Complex, multi-generational storylines with potentially permanent effects on the game world are a hallmark feature.

## Scale of Content

- **Ten playable races**, each with fully original histories and cultures
- **Sixty playable classes**, each with a unique play experience and lore

- A pantheon of **over 30 diverse gods** that actively shape the world
