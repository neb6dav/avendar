# Avendar: Calendar and Timekeeping

The Avendar Calendar was designed by an actual astronomer (**Synrael**), tweaked for playability, and reflects the unique world — including its **dual-lunar system**.

---

## The Moons of Avendar

Avendar has **two moons**, most commonly known by their aelin names:

| Aelin Name | Ancient Alatharyan Name |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Lunus** | Telianthis |
| **Rhos** | Nimiel |

The feast day descriptions represent traditions typical of aelin and human cultures.

## Days of the Week

Avendar's week consists of seven days:

| Day | Meaning |

| **Lyrensday** | "The day of the lyre" |
| **Iolenday** | "Jolinn's day" |
| **Thelansday** | "Telianthis' day" (the moon Lunus/Telianthis) |
| **Endenday** | "Iandir's day" |

## Months of the Year

## Feast Days and Cultural Traditions

### The Day of Year's End

Traditions vary greatly over this celebration. A widely held tradition is to honor **travellers** on this feast day, partly because the day represents transitions, and partly because with the easing of winter, traveling merchants and bards begin to take up their paths again. After long winters with little outside contact, smaller villages are very pleased to see the first of the year's peddlers and entertainers arrive.

### The Day of Quickening

One birthing term after the Quickening, this date (or around it) is the birthday of many — making it one of the most common birthdays in the calendar.

### Hearth Feast

In the dead of winter, one feast day celebrates the warmth of house and home, and of companionship and family. The feast generally involves large groups of family and neighbors gathering about a pre-selected hearth for feasting and music-making.

**The Day of Tears:** The hearth is chosen on the Day of Tears, and every day from that date a twig of **applewood** (for fertility) and a leaf of **oak** (for protection) is burned. The sanctified hearth is supposed to bring blessing on all who feast by it on the Hearth Feast.

## Named Months (Historical)

The month of **Lyceonis** is named after **Corvandil Lyceon**, the Earendam general who won the First Kankoran War — demonstrating how significant historical figures are commemorated in the calendar system.

The month **Rystaiamir** is named after **Rystaia**, the ch'taren Lightbringer — indicating the ch'taren's arrival and integration into Avendar's cultural landscape had sufficient impact to influence the calendar.

---

## In-Game Time

The Avendar calendar reflects a fully realized fantasy world with:
- Named days of the week connected to divine figures (Jolinn, Iandir, the moons)
- Seasonal feast days with rich cultural traditions
- A dual-moon astronomical system designed by a real astronomer for internal consistency
- Historical figures commemorated in month names
