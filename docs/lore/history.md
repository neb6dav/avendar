# Avendar: World History

## The Age of Creation

### The Overgods and the Prime Material

In the beginning were the gods — some to create, some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring hope. The gods were alone in the universe, and seeking a canvas for their essence, they created the world of Avendar.

In the primal Void, **Iandir** created the first matter. They cordoned off a fragment of the multiverse and began the slow process of fashioning a world. In time, the mountains rose, the seas formed, and wind carried dust and vapor throughout.

Their work attracted **Jolinn**, who proposed an addition: life. Iandir agreed. Jolinn set Himself to designing life and its mechanisms, which rapidly swept across Iandir's world.

Then came **Ashur**, the Great Dragon of the Void. It despised the fledgling world's existence but realized It was not powerful enough to oppose both Iandir and Jolinn. The Dragon offered Its own new law: death. Iandir accepted, as it offered necessary natural order. But Jolinn was angered. The Two quarreled, and this early disagreement threatened the world. As a result, Iandir proposed a solution — **the Compact**: the gods would no longer act directly upon the Prime Material, preventing an otherwise imminent divine war.

### The Alatharya — The First Race

Edged along by the gods of creation, they created the **alatharya**, the First Children of the gods. Ancient magic, as wielded by the gods, was infused into the Prime, transforming Jolinn's young Life into godlings in their own right. To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest gift — **Magic**: magic to create, magic to destroy.

As time passed, the alatharya waxed mighty. They built great cities with pyramids and strange rites, their priests and scholars commanded vast power, and civilization flourished on a scale never again seen.

## The Sundering

### The Theft and the Fall

But the alatharya were not pleased with the gods' plans to make other races. Jealous and coveting divine quintessence, they sought to steal the power of the gods. With their mighty pyramids and strange rites, their priests and scholars came together one fateful night for a grand theft — seeking to make of themselves creators.

The gods knew of the theft, and instead of granting power, they invoked their deepest and darkest wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the alatharya were rent in blood and fire — their libraries burned, their pyramids turned to rubble, their homes driven to the four winds.

> *"The revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can level entire worlds."*

### Consequences of the Sundering

The alatharya were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of races. No more would the minds of the alatharya follow the intricacies of magic. And lastly, the gods **sundered Magic** from its pure form into its elemental components:

- **Water**
- **Spirit** (Wind)
- **Air**
- **Fire**
- **Void**
- **Earth**

This sundering released cataclysmic storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, changing and altering all that they touched. The **aelin** were granted flight and the gift of keen reason. The **caladaran** learned wisdom and were turned from the night. The spark of the divine brought self-awareness to the primitive **srryn**.

The warping effect of the Sundering made the young shuddeni race especially susceptible to the insinuation of Tzet-Askhari as their true father, producing a mockery of Jolinn's desires. As a result, the shuddeni alone are fundamentally incapable of ever commanding the healing power of Water.

### The Aftermath

The centuries after the Sundering were dark ones. Magical storms scoured the surface of Avendar and released powerful elemental entities onto the Prime. For the battered alatharya, these beings posed a greater threat than the storms themselves.

Desperate and alone, the alatharya cried out to the heavens for succor, and their prayers were answered by **Elarandan** (later known as **Enirra**) — an entity who became their protector, acting in defiance of the Overgods. They enshrined the notion of *apotechta* — Elarandan's balance between natural and supernatural — into their dogma.

It was not until some hundreds of years that civilization began anew, with the proud **aelin** and their cities rising once more.

## The Age of Races

### Rise of the Aelin

With the collapse of alatharyan civilization and the mass extinction of the Sundering, the earliest to fill that vacuum were the forebears of the aelin. According to legend, these progenitors were granted their emblematic wings by the goddess who dwelled atop the Daphoan Ialiedae mountains — **Alil**.

The aelin built cities that at least faintly echoed the glories of ancient days, collecting the artifacts of the ancient alatharya. At their height, the aelin civilization of **Daphoa** was among the greatest in the post-Sundering world.

### Rise of the Srryn and Humans

The spark of the divine brought self-awareness to the primitive srryn. Some modern scholars suggest that it was the human gift for adaptation which brought about their alliance with the primitive srryn. The srryn discovered the magics of Fire, and humans, too, learned to wield it — a combination that would scorch the world with its fury.

## The War of Fire

The **War of Fire** is one of the first major conflicts in post-Sundering Avendar. Guided by **Sythrak** and **Bayyal**, srryn, humans, and nefortu used fire magics to ransack civilization:

- Sythraki srryn ravaged the kingdom of Caal, the aelin strongholds of the Brintors, and the Earendam river valley
- Bayyal's nefortu devastated the fertile civilization of **Ashta Harrud**
- The aelin did not abandon their cities — droves were killed and many cities destroyed
- The new chaja city of **Tisroc** was razed just after the war
- Sythrak himself led the saurian hordes to battle; his defeat was one from which his power never fully recovered

**Key Outcomes:**
- Destruction of the aelin empires and death on a scale unprecedented since the Sundering
- Unique Fire Templar class emerged from this era — the srryn applied magical capabilities in a characteristically brutal fashion
- Humans learned to wield fire magic alongside the srryn as the war escalated
- The old alatharyan civilization continued to huddle in secluded sanctuaries while the war raged

## Between the Wars

After the War of Fire, civilization slowly recovered. The **Republic of Earendam** rose as the central human power, named after the legendary Corvandil Lyceonis — its first Patrician — who won the First Kankoran War.

The **nefortu** established trade with Var Bandor and smaller settlements, founding their city-state of **Kohlis** on the principles of the goddess Ayaunj.

During this period, the **caladaran** arrived in the Earendam river basin and shared tales of their ancient deities, particularly **Jalassa**, goddess of psionics.

The god Jolinn, having expended great power during the Sundering to save the world, fell into a deep slumber — His influence on mortal affairs waned.

## The War of Night

The **War of Night** had a particularly lasting impact on the psyche of the aelin as a race. **Serachel** — originally sent by Jolinn as an emissary to war-torn aelin civilization — urged them to embrace the Void to defeat the shuddeni and create a mighty empire. Many of Serachel's followers did this, though it would eventually mean nothing.

### The Shuddeni Invasion

The shuddeni attempted to invade the surface world, wielding dark Void magic. Their plan went catastrophically wrong — a botched summoning brought the **ch'taren** and their spirit magics to Avendar. Possessed of both divine and extraplanar power, these were devastatingly effective against Void-mages and their demonic servitors.

### The Day of Two Dawns

Jolinn's Champions first opposed the diabolic magics of Void during the War of Night, sacrificing themselves to ward off the darkness until the **Day of Two Dawns** — the turning point of the war.

**Rystaia Lightbringer**, along with Aeolis, revealed the treacheries and corruption of the Dark Angel Serachel through the magics of Spirit. Serachel was defeated and cast into His nightmare realm for a millennium.

### Aftermath of the War of Night

The Republic collapsed under the strain of the Kankoran wars that followed. After the War of Night:
- Kankoran from the broken lands attacked the Republic in a series of wars
- The Republic collapsed, bringing rise to the independent city-states of today
- Much of Serachel's historical record was purged — countless records were destroyed
- The ch'taren established their havens on the Prime Material

---

## The Modern Era

### Independent City-States

The collapse of the Republic gave rise to the independent city-states that exist in the modern Avendar setting:
- **Earendam** — The great human city, still the dominant political entity
- **Var Bandor** — Another major city-state
- **Kohlis** — The nefortu city-state
- **Rahh-Nefor** — Nefortu city
- **Sythtys** (swamps) — Srryn homeland

### The Great Houses

With no overarching empire, the **Great Houses** serve as the primary factions through which organized conflict occurs. They fight ideological wars over control of the ten **Stones of Power** — mystical artifacts scattered across the world.

### Ongoing Cosmic Threats

- **Ashur** sleeps, but many believe It desires the total destruction of Avendar
- **Serachel** remains imprisoned in the Nightmare Realm, though His influence persists through His cult
- The **Compact** continues to govern divine-mortal interaction, though its limits are constantly tested
