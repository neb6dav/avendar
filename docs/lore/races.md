# Avendar: Races of the Prime Material

Avendar features ten playable lineages, each with fully original histories and cultures. The full in-game lore is documented in *The Races of Avendar* by Antaerus the Elder, Scribe of Earendam, found in the School of Heroes.

## Alatharya

> *"Silver-skinned giants, alatharya were cursed by the gods for their hubris."*

### Description
The alatharya are tall, silver-skinned humanoids of immense physical stature — comparable to giants. They are the oldest of the sapient races, having been created directly by the gods as the First Children. Despite their fall from grace, they retain a regal bearing and ancient pride.

### History
The alatharya were once the unquestioned masters of Avendar. The gods bestowed upon them the gift of Magic in its pure, undivided form, and they built a civilization of staggering complexity and power. Their pyramids stretched to the heavens, their libraries contained all mortal knowledge, and their scholars commanded forces no other race could comprehend.

Their fall came when jealousy overcame wisdom. Seeking to steal divine quintessence from the gods themselves, the alatharya attempted a grand ritual of theft. The gods' combined wrath unmade their civilization in blood and fire — an event known as **the Sundering**. Magic was forever fragmented into six elemental spheres, and the alatharya's capacity for arcane mastery was stripped from them.

In the age after the Sundering, magical storms scoured the surface of Avendar. The alatharya cried out for succor, and their prayers were answered by **Elarandan** (Enirra), who became their protector. They enshrined the concept of *apotechta* — balance between the natural and supernatural — into their dogma.

### Current State
After many centuries of dominating every facet of the realm, the alatharya have truly declined. While the War of Fire ravaged others, the alatharya continued to huddle in secluded sanctuaries scattered from the Brintors, to the Mlejin Range, to the Rirro Jagka.

### Racial Traits
- Immense physical strength and constitution
- Stripped of significant magical ability as divine punishment
- Patron deity: **Enirra** (Elarandan)
- Vulnerability: Cannot match other races in magical pursuits

## Aelin

> *"The sophisticated aelins fly with avian grace."*

### Description
Aelin appear as delicate, attractive humanoids, usually with light-colored hair and curving, pointed ears. All aelin have wings, the color of which has traditionally shown great variety. They are graceful, quick of mind, and culturally sophisticated.

### History
With the collapse of alatharyan civilization after the Sundering, the aelin were among the first to fill the vacuum. The goddess **Alil** dwelt atop the Daphoan Ialiedae mountains and, according to legend, granted the progenitors of the aelin race their emblematic wings.

The aelin built impressive post-Sundering cities in **Daphoa**, collecting alatharyan artifacts and echoing ancient glories. The **War of Fire** devastated their civilization — while other races abandoned their cities, the aelin did not. Initially lacking the magics of water to defend themselves, droves of aelin were killed and many cities destroyed.

The **War of Night** had a particularly lasting impact on the aelin psyche. **Serachel** — originally sent by Jolinn as an emissary to the war-torn aelin — urged them to embrace the Void and create a mighty empire. Many followed, forming the origin of the infamous diabolic **ginta**. Serachel was ultimately defeated by Rystaia and imprisoned in the Nightmare Realm.

The **Dalae era**, inspired by Serachel's early influence, vastly expanded the roles of women in aelin society and dismissed traditional behavioral prohibitions. The aelin have since been divided between the followers of **Aeolis** and the darker influence of **Serachel**.

### Racial Traits
- Natural flight via the `fly` command
- Movement costs lowered while flying; regenerate movement points more slowly in flight
- **Resistance** to lightning damage; bonus to saves against lightning
- **Vulnerability** to blunt damage (such as Earth magic)
- Patron deities: **Alil**, **Aeolis**, **Serachel**

## Caladaran

> *"Psychic manifestation, historically, has been exceedingly rare outside the confines of the caladaran race."*

### Description
The caladaran are a thoughtful, introspective people renowned for their extraordinary mental capabilities. They appear as humanoids of moderate build with an otherworldly quality to their gaze — eyes that seem to look inward as much as outward.

### History
With their arrival in the Earendam river basin, the caladaran shared tales of their ancient deities. In particular, they spoke of **Jalassa**, the goddess to whom they credited the revelation of their unusual power: **psionics**. With magic waxing strong in the Republic at the time, tales of unknown mental powers were not easily believed.

The village of **Jindaska** is the homeland of the caladaran race, and breathes the spirit of that race with all its quests and inhabitants.

### Racial Traits
- Access to the psionicist class as their primary cultural specialty
- Exceptional intelligence and wisdom
- The assassin class developed in part from caladaran monastic living
- Patron deity: **Jalassa**

---

## Ch'taren

> *"From another plane, the ch'taren stand vigilant against the forces of evil."*

### Description
The ch'taren are humanoids of otherworldly beauty, with an innate aura of divine protection. They are the newest race to join Avendar's racial tapestry — their arrival was not by choice, but by necessity.

### History
The ch'taren once inhabited a plane of existence beyond the scope of the Compact. There, they were born and nurtured by their twin gods, **Rystaia** and **Vaialos**. Vaialos is attributed as the source of the ch'taren's tremendous intellect, while Rystaia shaped their hearts.

Cataclysm struck in the form of **Tzet-Askhari** (Ashur), the Overgod and Bringer of Ends. Because the ch'taren home plane existed outside of the Compact, the Dragon ravaged and consumed both the Twins' world and their creations. Rystaia and Her priest **Shathalith** prepared the ch'taren for passage to the Prime, while Vaialos confronted Tzet-Askhari alone. In a desperate attempt to buy time, He battled the Dragon but was consumed in the process. His sacrifice was not in vain — Rystaia and the ch'taren escaped.

During the **War of Night**, the shuddeni's botched summoning accidentally brought the ch'taren to Avendar. Possessed of spirit magic, they proved devastatingly effective against Void-mages. Shielded by the Compact, the ch'taren and their goddess revealed the treacheries of Serachel, leading to his defeat.

**Ch'taren havens** have not existed without struggle:
- **Ad'mastaesia** was overrun by a combined force of shuddeni and srryn and is now home only to ghosts and memories
- **Jh'ten** has closed itself away after an attempt to disease its people
- **Avayn** has long been insular, with only rare traders and ambassadors emerging

### Racial Traits
- **Always Good** alignment — cannot be played as neutral or evil
- Exceptional intelligence
- Innate connection to Spirit magic
- Twin patron deities: **Rystaia** (Lightbringer) and **Vaialos** (the Sacrificed)
- Cannot study psionics due to inherently chaotic nature despite high intelligence

## Chaja

> *"A race long enslaved by the shuddeni, a growing free population has emerged in the surface world."*

### Description
Chaja are very tall humanoids, comparable in stature to an alatharya, yet possessing more agile frames that lack obvious muscular definition owing to layers of subcutaneous fat. They possess little innate sexual dimorphism. They have ample amounts of thick body hair and frequently facial hair regardless of sex — all naturally oily, thought to protect them from the cold and damp of their preferred subterranean living spaces. Hair color ranges from white to black.

### History
Chaja are a traditionally subterranean race, known widely for their countless generations of enslavement by the shuddeni. In the centuries just preceding the War of Fire, many chaja cities fell to Daphoan imperialism. After human and srryn fire mages began their fiery genocide across the western half of Avendar, what few remaining above-ground chaja cities were reduced to cinders.

During the later eras, Marlax's near-genocidal anti-chaja campaign in the **Brintors**, as well as shuddeni expansion, destroyed multiple chaja cities. The new chaja settlement of **Tisroc** — a mixed community of free and formerly enslaved chaja south of Earendam — was razed just after the War of Fire.

While many chaja remain under the yoke of their eyeless shuddeni oppressors, a growing free population has emerged in the surface world, in both major Avendarian cities and in their own secluded mountain enclaves. They were originally only encountered as NPCs before gaining playable status for players with good accounts.

### Racial Traits
- Exceptional physical resilience from subcutaneous fat
- Natural adaptation to cold and subterranean environments
- Resistance to cold; vulnerability in dry or hot climates

## Ethron

> *"Charged by Elar the All-Mother to defend Her creation."*

### Description
The ethron are a nature-attuned people, deeply connected to the living world around them. They are the oldest of the druidic traditions — the ethron were the first to compose druidic orders, charged as they were by **Elar** to defend Her creation.

### History
The ethron triad of deities — **Elar**, **Nariel**, and **Lielqan** — shaped ethron culture from its earliest days. Elar is known as the sculptor of the ethron race, and Her devoted are nearly always found in ethron settlements or wandering the majestic wildlands she helped create.

Elar loves Nariel first amongst her children, but does not always aid her adventurous impulses — friction stems from Nariel gifting forbidden knowledge to the ethron as a whole. Lielqan, the third of the triad, is the goddess of resurrection, and her indiscriminate gift of second life is a source of ongoing theological debate.

### Racial Traits
- Deep affinity for nature magic and druidic traditions
- Patron deities: **Elar** (All-Mother), **Nariel** (the Wandering), **Lielqan** (Sunset)
- Often found in wild areas and ethron settlements rather than major cities

## Human

> *"Humans, with their tremendous capacity for adaptation and change, flourished in the wake of the Sundering."*

### Description
Humans are the most widespread and adaptable of Avendar's races. With no single distinctive physical trait, they vary enormously in appearance, culture, and temperament — their greatest strength is their capacity for change and growth.

### History
With the birth of His final design — humanity — **Jolinn** fell into a deep slumber, and His influence on mortal affairs waned. Humans flourished in the wake of the Sundering, becoming the most politically dominant race on the Prime Material.

Human scholars, following infamous pioneers like the **Lilunite Archmage Kaagn**, descended into the dark underworld in search of greater power — contributing to the development of Void scholarship.

The **Republic of Earendam** stands as the greatest human achievement, though it collapsed under the strain of the Kankoran wars following the War of Night, giving rise to the independent city-states of the modern era.

### Racial Traits
- Most balanced stat distribution of any race
- Access to the widest variety of classes
- Patron deity: **Jolinn** (among others — humans maintain the most varied religious traditions)
- No elemental resistances or vulnerabilities
- Greatest racial flexibility in roleplay and class choices

---

## Kankoran

> *"The wolfish kankoran affiliated by tradition with tribe-packs."*

### Description
Kankoran appear as tall humanoids with varying colors of fur and eyes. They tend to express themselves with the movement of their ears, much like a canine would. Despite popular belief, they do not possess tails. They are normally rather robust, with large upper torsos and arms, powerful legs, and thick jaws.

### History
Kankoran are a nomadic people, often found in the northern reaches of Avendar where the climate is colder. They travel in packs, usually organized by tartans or other similar fetishes and symbols showing loyalty to a given pack or name.

After the **War of Night**, kankoran from the broken lands attacked the Republic in a series of wars — events that contributed significantly to the collapse of the Republic of Earendam.

### Racial Traits
- **Resistance** to cold damage
- **Vulnerability** to fire damage
- Pack-based social structure
- Excellent physical combat capabilities
- Tendency toward northern territories and colder climates

## Nefortu

> *"Among the preeminent merchants and traders of the continent."*

### Description
Nefortu possess a natural elegance and commercial acumen that has made them some of the most successful traders in Avendar. Like the aelin, nefortu have the ability to fly naturally.

### History
After the War of Fire, many nefortu aligned themselves with **Bayyal**, whom they regarded as the winner of the conflict. The nefortu city-state of **Kohlis** flourished as they established trade with nearby **Var Bandor** and a multitude of smaller settlements, founding their community on the principles of the goddess **Ayaunj**. Kohlis was founded under the sign of Ayaunj's sacred amber dragon.

The practice of Void templarhood has particular allure amongst nefortu mercenaries.

### Racial Traits
- Natural flight via the `fly` command
- Patron deities: **Ayaunj**, **Bayyal**, **Tzajai**
- Commercial and social aptitude
- City-state: **Kohlis** (primary), **Rahh-Nefor**, **Var Bandor** (trade partner)

## Shuddeni

> *"A race whose hatred runs ancient and deep as their subterranean cities."*

### Description
The shuddeni are a pale, eyeless (or near-blind in surface conditions) subterranean race of slight build. Their hatred — both of the surface world and of themselves — is as ancient as their civilization. They are one of the defining forces of evil in Avendar.

### History
The shuddeni, despite being alive, have no glimmer of Jolinn's goodness within them. The warping effect of the Sundering made the young shuddeni race especially susceptible to the insinuation of **Tzet-Askhari** as their true father, producing a mockery of Jolinn's desires. As a result, the shuddeni alone are fundamentally incapable of ever commanding the healing power of Water.

The magics of **Void** were born of the shuddeni and their master, Tzet-Askhari, and became the binding thread that held their fragile, volatile society together. In the centuries before contact with other races, this power determined who directed shuddeni lives.

Void templars first rose to prominence during the **War of Night**. The shuddeni attempted to invade the surface, wielding dark Void magic, but ultimately failed when a botched summoning brought the ch'taren and their spirit magics to Avendar. Due to their shuddeni roots, shuddeni are the primary dedicants of the Void templar profession.

Due to their vast knowledge and cruel lusts, the shuddeni have also left an indelible mark on assassinry.

### Racial Traits
- **Always Evil** alignment — cannot be played as neutral or good
- Cannot command Water magic (healing) — the most significant racial restriction
- Masters of Void magic and the assassin's arts
- Subterranean origin — adapted to darkness
- Patron deity: **Sitheus** (Void scholarship), **Lilune**, and others of the dark pantheon
- Eyeless (or heavily reduced vision) in surface conditions

## Srryn

> *"Reptilian saurians from the swamps with a reputation for savage nastiness."*

### Description
The srryn are a race of reptilian humanoids (saurians) originating from the swamps and wetlands of Avendar. They have a reputation for brutality and savage direct action, a cultural trait dating to their early alliance with human fire-mages during the War of Fire.

### History
The spark of the divine brought self-awareness to the primitive srryn. They discovered the magics of **Fire**, and their alliance with humans during the War of Fire saw them at the height of their power. The Sythraki srryn ravaged entire civilizations, following the divine will of **Sythrak**, their patron deity.

The defeat of Sythrak during the War of Fire ended the srryn's period of dominance. Many srryn now live in the **swamps of Sythtys**, their lifestyle not developed far beyond their earliest days. While some have moved to cities and guilds, many still cling to their ancient lifestyle.

By way of **Sitheus**, even the srryn found themselves taken by blood pacts and control of the dead — contributing to srryn Void scholarship.

### Racial Traits
- **Resistance** to fire damage
- Natural affinity for fire magic
- Patron deity: **Sythrak** (Saurian Lord/Lord of Mires)
- Homeland: **Sythtys** (swamps)
- Often play as barbarian-style warriors or fire magic users
