# Avendar: The Pantheon

The Prime Material in which Avendar resides was created by the **three Overgods — Iandir, Jolinn, and Ashur** — who in turn created many deities to help steward their new creation. Each god pursues their own interests and plans, and most native lineages have their own presiding trinity of deities that shaped their chosen people's culture and history.

Through their following, religious artifice, Great Houses, and individually chosen immortal divines, deities may enact their designs upon the world in accordance with the ancient **Compact** laid down by the Overgods. Deities rarely manifest bodily in the world, but when they do it is usually in the form most familiar to their chosen lineage.

All deities ultimately bow to the will and might of the Overgods, whose power is absolute — though some more resentfully than others. The gods are ubiquitous in Avendar and intervene regularly in the lives of mortals to the degree the Compact allows. Even the casual, passing attention of a divinity can leave a mark on a person's soul that manifests on their body, known as a **god touch**.

> Avendar was originally conceived by three individuals whose identities correspond to the three Overgods:
> - **Matt Wallace** — Ashur
> - **Thane Williams** — Iandir
> - **Brandon Downey** — Jolinn

## The Three Overgods

### Iandir — *The Architect / Overgod of Creation*

**Alignment:** True Neutral
**Portfolio:** Creation, Law, Natural Order, Balance

In the primal Void, Iandir created the first matter. They cordoned off a fragment of the multiverse and fashioned a world — mountains rose, seas formed, wind carried dust and vapor throughout. When the innate laws governing the natural world were complete, Iandir delighted in watching the clockwork of this perfect machine.

Iandir's notion of law operates on many levels — from the specific code of the Guardians of Law to the fundamental, physical laws of nature. Iandir views things on a systemic level; even typically chaotic-seeming functions, such as destruction and death, can be understood as part of the greater systemic narrative.

**Neutrality is the primary alignment** — a foundation laid by Iandir when the world was created. Later, Jolinn and Ashur brought Good and Evil, building walls where none had been.

When Jolinn and Ashur quarreled over the nature of death, Iandir proposed the Compact — the gods would no longer act directly upon the Prime Material — preventing an otherwise imminent divine war.

### Jolinn — *The Father of the Seas / Lord of the Sapphire Spear / Overgod of Life*

**Alignment:** Lawful Good
**Portfolio:** Life, Order, Purpose, Harmony, the Sea

Jolinn's desire for purpose inspired His own offering to the new world: life. After Iandir's effort manifested the physical world, Jolinn set Himself to turning Form into Being. With the birth of His final design — humanity — the Father of the Seas fell into a deep slumber, and His influence on mortal affairs waned.

Jolinn was angered when Ashur introduced death to His creations. He values choice — given the ability to decide their own destinies, Jolinn hopes all mortals will ultimately choose to be as He is.

On a cosmic scale, the side of "Good" is headed by **Jolinn**, the Overgod of Life. Jolinn and His Champions fought the machinations of evil throughout the ages — during the War of Night, they first opposed the diabolic magics of Void and sacrificed themselves to ward off the darkness until the Day of Two Dawns.

**Followers:** Jolinn's most well-established followings were founded by humans (due to His distance from mortal affairs from the Sundering until the War of Fire). Ethron and caladaran also count among those who heed His call.

---

### Ashur — *The Great Dragon / Tzet-Askhari / Dragon of Death / Overgod of Destruction*

**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
**Portfolio:** Death, Destruction, Void, Entropy

Ashur came to Iandir and Jolinn's creation and despised its existence, but realized It was not powerful enough to oppose both at once. The Dragon offered Its own new law: death. Iandir accepted this as necessary natural order. Jolinn was angered. Their quarrel threatened the world, leading to the Compact.

Ashur **sleeps at present**, but Its disapproval of Jolinn's work is common knowledge. Many believe It desires the total destruction of the world of Avendar. While evil-aligned gods ostensibly serve Ashur, direct orders are exceedingly rare while the Dragon slumbers — they are left to their own devices.

As a planar sphere, Void magic is not strictly granted by any individual god, yet it is undeniable that all of its power inevitably derives from the will of Ashur.

Ashur is also referred to by scholars as **Tzet-Askhari**, a name used in pre-Sundering alatharyan texts.

## Major Deities

### Rystaia — *The Lightbringer*

**Alignment:** Chaotic Good
**Portfolio:** Freedom, Opposition to Tyranny, Spirit Magic
**Primary Race:** Ch'taren

Rystaia is one of the twin creators of the ch'taren race. Together with Her brother **Vaialos**, She breathed life into the earliest ch'taren and nurtured the fledgling race in its infancy. When Tzet-Askhari consumed the ch'taren home plane, it was Rystaia and Her priest Shathalith who prepared the ch'taren for passage to the Prime Material. Vaialos sacrificed Himself to buy time, and was consumed by the Dragon.

Shielded by the Compact on the Prime, Rystaia and the ch'taren revealed the treacheries and corruption of the Dark Angel Serachel through the magics of Spirit. Serachel was defeated and cast into His nightmare realm for a millennium.

Rystaia dreams of the scouring of darkness in all its forms. She empowers Her followers to know no compromise in matters of tyranny. To Rystaia, a perfect world is one in which none are hindered by oppression — even that which was intended for the greater good. This makes Her place an interesting one: Her will helped save Avendar from certain destruction, yet Her free-spirited manner is often at odds with the civilizations She and Her children saved.

Rystaia, along with Aeolis and Jolinn, acts as a patron deity of the **Champions of Avendar** house. Her religion is well-tolerated in Earendam despite Her infamous opposition to Iandiric law.

### Serachel — *The Lord of the Fallen / The Dark Angel*

**Alignment:** Lawful Evil
**Portfolio:** Darkness, Corruption, Fallen Angels, the Aelin
**Primary Race:** Aelin (historically)

Jolinn, taking pity on the aelin for their plight during His long slumber, sent the servitor-god Serachel as His emissary to the war-torn aelin civilization. The precise goals of Serachel are as secretive as His following. With the purge of countless records after the War of Night, much of Serachel's historical character is the subject of conjecture.

Serachel urged the aelin to embrace the Void to defeat the shuddeni and create a mighty empire. Many followed. He was ultimately defeated by Rystaia and imprisoned in the Nightmare Realm — though He is expected to return after His millennium of imprisonment ends.

**Divine Relationships:**
- **Aeolis** is Serachel's primary rival. In many ways, Serachel represents a warped reflection of the ancient worship of Aeolis.
- **Alil** is largely viewed by Serachel as a prize of His competition with Aeolis — Her corruption would be a final, demoralizing masterstroke.

Serachel stands high as a god of darkness — His intrigues and successes outmatch many of His deific brethren. As patron of the **Coven of the Shunned**, Serachel's will is wrought through far more mortal hands than many of His evil counterparts. He is hated, but grudgingly respected, particularly within the lower powers of the pantheon.

---

### Alil — *The Winged Goddess / Goddess of the Aelin*

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral (historically fluctuating)
**Portfolio:** Aelin, Wings, Light, Fire (in her mad form)
**Primary Race:** Aelin

Alil dwelt atop the Daphoan Ialiedae mountains and, according to legend, granted the progenitors of the aelin their emblematic wings. She was a goddess deeply resonant with mortal emotion.

During the War of Fire, Alil defied the inaction of **Aeoleri** and appeared high above the southern province of Illata, destroying all life in it in a conflagration of light and fire. Mad with divine pain from her followers' collective terror, her organized following seized the imperial court, naming her de facto head of state.

Driven out by force, the Aeolians retreated to the fringes of Daphoan society. With the coming of Serachel, the fabled **Dalae era** began — roles of women vastly expanded, and traditional Aeolian behavioral prohibitions were dismissed.

Conspiring with **Rystaia Lightbringer**, Aeoleri imprisoned Alil to keep her from protecting Serachel from Rystaia's assault.

---

### Enirra — *The Balance / Elarandan*

**Alignment:** True Neutral
**Portfolio:** Balance, Stability, Protection of the Alatharya
**Primary Race:** Alatharya

After the Sundering, the battered alatharya cried out for succor, and their prayers were answered by an entity known as **Elarandan**. She became their protector, acting in defiance of the Overgods by steeling them to endure. They enshrined the notion of *apotechta* — Elarandan's balance between natural and supernatural — into their dogma.

Balance has been used as shorthand for Enirra's ideals, and almost all of her followers' actions are in some way tied to it.

**Relationship with Lielqan:** Enirra's most important relationship is with Lielqan. She views Her as paradoxically the greatest proponent of stability and the most significant threat to it. Lielqan's indiscriminate resurrection of the dead maddens Enirra — pleased when it halts dreaded change, angered when it prevents disruptions from being neatly resolved. Enirra's warriors frequently put those who serve the Sunset to the sword.

**The Apotechta:** These are descended from the oldest alatharyan Enirrans. Taking their name from Elarandan's balance, they are trained for battle with sapient magical creatures — elementals, djinn, seraphim, and demons. The most radical consider branded followers of other deities of similar cast. Wary of arcanists who manipulate Spirit and Void, the Apotechta hunt such beings with expert proficiency.

### Sythrak — *The Saurian Lord / Lord of Mires*

**Alignment:** Neutral Evil
**Portfolio:** Srryn, Swamps, Decay, Nature (Corrupted)
**Primary Race:** Srryn

Sythrak is one of the **oldest gods** of Avendar. The patron of the second-oldest sapient race, He came into being with the rise of the saurians, and extended His influence over the swamps and wetlands in which His people laired.

At the apex of His power, His will roused the saurian hordes to battle in the **War of Fire**. His defeat in that epic struggle was one from which His power never fully recovered. An old god, Sythrak has enmeshed Himself intractably with the fabric of Avendar as one of the three gods of Nature (alongside Girikha and Elar).

Sythrak's foremost goal is the primacy of the srryn race, through whatever means available. Force of arms and subjugation is the most common method among the more barbaric of the srryn, and the most prone to failure. While He would wish nothing more than to see the warmbloodied races wiped out, it has become clear that such a tactic is doomed. For now, Sythrak further entrenches Himself and His following.

**Divine Relationships:**
- Adversarial with most of the pantheon
- Slight measure of respect for **Girikha** and **Elar**, tinged with envy (he hungers to add their portfolios to his)
- Closest ally: **Bayyal** (though this alliance is tenuous — the Lord of Destruction seeks to reduce Avendar to a glowing ember, which does not serve Sythrak)

**Cults:**
- **The Saurian Sept** — Believes in the primacy of the srryn by force of arms (oldest cult)
- **The Swamplords** — Sinister naturalists and swamp-dwelling srryn who worship Sythrak as Lord of Mires; seek to widen His influence by spreading decay and befouling all wilds into fetid swamp
- **Reptile Shamans** — A contemplative following that worships by revering Sythrak's scaled creations; protect, nurture, and tame cold-blooded creatures

---

### Bayyal — *Lord of Destruction / The Fiery Rage*

**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
**Portfolio:** Fire, Destruction, War, Nefortu (some)
**Primary Race:** Nefortu (historically)

Bayyal burst from the heart of the earth, and even the gods found themselves helpless against His fury. During the **War of Fire**, Bayyal's nefortu devastated the fertile civilization of **Ashta Harrud**. Many nefortu aligned themselves with Bayyal, whom they regarded as the winner of the conflict.

Even Sythrak acknowledges that Bayyal's ultimate goal — reducing Avendar to a glowing ember — does not serve anyone's long-term interests. Their alliance is tenuous at best.

---

### Elar — *The All-Mother / Heart of Nature*

**Alignment:** Neutral Good
**Portfolio:** Nature, Life, Ethron, Creation
**Primary Race:** Ethron

Elar's worship is traditionally ethron, who know Her as the sculptor of their race. Her devoted are nearly always found in ethron settlements or wandering the majestic wildlands she helped create. Larger Avendarian cities have few devotees of Elar, focused as they are on more law-based deities such as Iandir or Rveyelhi.

**The Ethron Triad:** The most important relationships to Elar are with the rest of the ethron triad — **Nariel** and **Lielqan**. While Elar loves Nariel first amongst her children, she does not always aid Nariel's adventurous impulses. Friction stems from Nariel gifting forbidden knowledge to the ethron as a whole.

Elar is one of the three gods of nature, alongside **Girikha** and **Sythrak** — though her relationship with Sythrak is one of barely concealed rivalry, as he envies her portfolio.

---

### Ayaunj — *The Amber Dragon / Goddess of Commerce*

**Alignment:** Neutral
**Portfolio:** Trade, Commerce, Nefortu prosperity
**Primary Race:** Nefortu

The city of Kohlis was founded under the sign of Ayaunj's sacred amber dragon, on the principles She espoused. Ayaunj is little-liked in **Rahh-Nefor**, hearkening back to a centuries-old rift between Her and **Tzajai**.

Nariel finds Ayaunj contemptible on an ideological level.
