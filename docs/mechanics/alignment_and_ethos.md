# Avendar: Alignment and Ethos

Alignment in Avendar operates on a **two-axis system**:

- **Alignment** — Your position on the Good–Neutral–Evil axis
- **Ethos** — Your position on the Lawful–Neutral–Chaotic axis

Generally, the word "alignment" is used colloquially to refer to both alignment and ethos together.

## The Cosmic Framework

### Neutrality as the Foundation

> *"Neutrality is the primary alignment — a foundation laid by Iandir, Overgod of Creation, when the world was created. Later, Jolinn and Ashur brought Good and Evil, building walls where none had been."*

The world was built on **Iandir's** natural order — a neutral baseline. Jolinn introduced Good (the gift of life and purpose), while Ashur introduced Evil (the law of death and destruction). This cosmic structure underlies the entire alignment system.

### Cosmic Good vs. Evil

| Cosmic Side | Leader | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Good** | Jolinn (Overgod of Life) | Life, harmony, choice, purpose |
| **Neutral** | Iandir (Overgod of Creation) | Natural law, order, the system as a whole |
| **Evil** | Ashur / Tzet-Askhari (Overgod of Destruction) | Death, entropy, destruction of Jolinn's work |

While evil gods ostensibly serve Ashur, direct orders are exceedingly rare while the Dragon sleeps — they are left to their own devices.

## Alignment Axis (Good/Neutral/Evil)

### Good

Good characters in Avendar genuinely care about others and are willing to take risks to help them:
- Will generally prefer to fight evil rather than each other
- Will take significant personal risks to protect and provide for the innocent
- Are not passive — Good does not mean pacifistic when evil threatens

### Neutral

Neutral characters do not strongly commit to either the cosmic forces of Good or Evil:
- May pursue personal goals without moral framework
- Can be motivated by pragmatism, self-interest, or ideological positions that don't fit either extreme
- A truly neutral character acknowledges that both forces have their place in the cosmic order

### Evil

Evil characters embrace harm, exploitation, or destruction:
- Draw power from the suffering or domination of others
- May serve Ashur's greater agenda or operate purely for selfish ends
- The primary evil axis includes varying degrees of cruelty, from calculated manipulation to savage violence

## Ethos Axis (Lawful/Neutral/Chaotic)

### Lawful Good

> *"Characters believe in an unfettered pursuit of goodness and tend to view laws or rules — even benign ones — with suspicion, if not outright disbelief."*

*(Note: This description appears to be for Chaotic Good in source material — Lawful Good would emphasize law AND good working together.)*

**Lawful Good** characters:
- Believe good is best achieved through proper order and structure
- Follow rules because they genuinely believe structured society protects the innocent
- May conflict with Rystaia's followers (she opposes tyranny even from benevolent lawful forces)

### Chaotic Good

> *"Characters believe in an unfettered pursuit of goodness and tend to view laws or rules — even benign ones — with suspicion, if not outright disbelief."*

Chaotic Good characters pursue good through freedom rather than law. **Rystaia's** faith exemplifies this — Her will helped save Avendar from certain destruction, yet Her free-spirited manner is often at odds with the civilizations She and Her children saved.

### Lawful Neutral

> *"Characters tend to view order as the fundamental that guides the multiverse and are often organizers who appreciate law in all of its forms."*

Lawful Neutral characters value order for its own sake, independent of whether the outcome is good or evil.

### Lawful Evil

> *"Characters often seek to gain control of extant power structures and apply them to their own ends, with long-term planning, scheming, and plotting as hallmarks."*

Lawful Evil characters are calculating manipulators who use structure and organization to further evil ends. **Serachel's** cult and many shuddeni fall into this category. Void magic itself resonates with Lawful Evil.

### Chaotic Evil

> *"Characters draw their power from complete disdain for all manners of order; they are violent, unpredictable, and savage — often believing only that the strong rule the weak."*

Chaotic Evil characters embody pure destructive impulse. **Bayyal**, the nefortu god of fiery rage, exemplifies this alignment at a divine level.

## Racial Alignment Restrictions

Some races have **mandatory alignment requirements** that cannot be changed:

| Race | Alignment Restriction |
|------|----------------------|
| **Ch'taren** | Always Good — cannot be neutral or evil |
| **Shuddeni** | Always Evil — cannot be neutral or good |

These restrictions reflect the fundamental nature of these races as shaped by the Overgods:
- Ch'taren were created by Rystaia and Vaialos, divine beings of light
- Shuddeni were warped by Tzet-Askhari (Ashur) and are fundamentally incapable of Jolinn's goodness

## Magic Alignment Restrictions

Certain elemental spheres have alignment requirements:

| Sphere | Restriction |
|--------|------------|
| **Void** | Cannot be studied by Good-aligned characters OR Chaotic ethos characters; resonates with Lawful Evil |
| **Air** | Cannot be studied by Lawful ethos characters; Air is a force of Chaos |

## Alignment and Game Mechanics

### XP Gain

Alignment affects experience point gain from combat:
- **Good characters** gain more XP from killing evil mobs
- **Good characters** lose XP if they kill good mobs
- **Evil characters** get extra XP for killing good mobs
- **Evil characters** gain slightly less XP for killing other evil creatures

This creates a mechanical bias toward good alignments, as many areas are populated with aggressive evil creatures.

### Rarely Alignment-Locked Items

Some items or tasks may be alignment-locked, preventing use by characters of certain alignments. This is described as rare — most gear is usable regardless of alignment.

### God Touch

Even the casual, passing attention of a divinity can leave a mark on a person's soul that manifests on their body — known as a **god touch**. A character's alignment strongly influences which deities might touch them and how.

## The Compact and Alignment

The **Compact** laid down by the Overgods governs how deities interact with the mortal world. Deities rarely manifest bodily, and when they do it is usually in the form most familiar to their chosen lineage. The alignment of the deity closely mirrors the alignment restrictions placed on their followers.

**Champions of Avendar** (the Good-aligned house) is patronized by:
- **Rystaia** (Chaotic Good)
- **Aeolis** (Good)
- **Jolinn** (Lawful Good, Overgod)

This combination reflects the diversity of Good-aligned approaches — from ordered heroism to chaotic freedom-fighting.

## Roleplay Implications

Alignment in Avendar is not merely mechanical — it is a roleplaying commitment:
- Any time you are logged in, you are expected to remain **in-character**
- Your alignment should inform how your character makes decisions, resolves conflicts, and relates to the world
- House membership often correlates with alignment (Guardians of Law for lawful characters; Shunned for evil characters)

Good-aligned characters are not passive — they are expected to **actively oppose evil** when they encounter it. Simply avoiding evil is not enough; good characters take significant personal risks to protect and provide for the innocent.
