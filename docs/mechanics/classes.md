## Scholars (Elemental Mages)

Scholars are the primary arcane casters of Avendar, drawing power from one or more of the six elemental spheres: **Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Spirit, and Void**.

### Scholar Basics

At creation, a scholar chooses a **major sphere** and may also choose a **minor sphere**. Specializing in a single sphere makes a character a **Greater Scholar** of that element, unlocking the most powerful spells available to that sphere. Combining two spheres offers versatility and access to unique **mixed-sphere** abilities.

**Mixed-sphere examples:**
- Fire + Earth = Lava spells
- Spirit + Air = unique combination abilities
- Water + Void = unique combination abilities

Scholars begin weak but gradually grow into powerful archmages through diligent practice and training.

---

### Air Scholar

Air magic encompasses the forces of wind, lightning, weather, and illusion. The sphere is associated with **chaos** — no lawful character may master Air as a profession.

**Notable Air spells:**
- Illusion and misdirection magic
- Lightning and storm-based attacks
- Flight and aerial mobility

**Alignment restriction:** Cannot be lawful ethos

---

### Earth Scholar

Earth magic encompasses the forces of stone, metal, magnetism, and geological power. Earth is associated with the blunt, heavy force of the physical world.

**Notable Earth spells:**
- Rune of Fire — marks invisible runes on objects or doors; anyone who attempts to open or touch them is blasted
- Stone-based offensive and defensive spells
- Magnetism and metal manipulation

---

### Fire Scholar

> *"Born of destruction, of heat, of magma, the Fire Scholar calls forth all the most offensive powers in the world."*

Fire Scholars are among the most straightforwardly offensive of the scholar classes, bringing destruction and burning to their foes.

**Notable Fire spells:**
- **Jaziji's Fade** — Allows the scholar to fade into thin air above any source of flame, concealing themselves while continuously draining mana
- **Rain of Fire** — Calls fire to rain from the heavens; those struck are set aflame for two and a half hours (outdoors only)
- **Blazing Inferno** — Starts a blazing inferno in the caster's room, spreading walls of fire at every exit and expanding room to room; cannot be cast on/under water or in the air
- **Frenzy** — Imbues its target with rage, granting bonus to hitroll and damroll but penalizing armor class; targets cannot retreat or cower while frenzied; cannot be cast on someone already berserk

**History:** Unique amongst the spheres, Fire templars predate their scholarly brethren. The srryn applied fire magic in a characteristically brutal fashion during the War of Fire.

---

### Water Scholar

Water magic encompasses healing, ice, and the fluid forces of the ocean and rain. It is the primary sphere for healing and restoration.

**Notable traits:**
- Primary healing sphere — shuddeni are uniquely incapable of ever commanding Water magic
- Ice and cold-based offensive spells
- Storm and rain manipulation

---

### Spirit Scholar

> *"In contrast to the Void, Spirit magic concerns itself with the Weave, the flow of life Jolinn produced from primal chaos."*

Spirit magic was brought to the world of Avendar by the **ch'taren** during the War of Night, including its martial variation, the Spirit Templar. Possessed of both divine and extraplanar power, these magics were devastatingly effective against Void-mages and their demonic servitors.

**Greater Spirit Scholar paths:**
At creation, a Spirit Scholar may choose to focus on one element (becoming a Greater) or diversify their studies to include a secondary sphere. Their minor sphere will:
- Flavor the manifestation and/or avatar they create
- Provide alternate functionality to class spells
- Duplicate active spells to their bond target

**Notable Spirit spells/skills (early):**
- Level 1: `dagger`, `mace`, `staff`, `concentration`, `lore`, `recover`, `searing light`
- Level 2: `armor`
- Level 3: `wands`, `second sight`
- Level 4: `Weavecraft`
- Level 5: `scrolls`, `twinkle`
- Level 6: `meditation`, `undying radiance`
- Level 7: `staves`
- Level 8: `Leyceran absorption`
- Level 9: `bless`
- Level 10: `invisibility`
- Level 11: `scan`
- Level 12: `intercession`
- Level 13: `mana conduit`
- Level 16: `second attack`
- Level 18: `trance`
- Level 34: `mirror boon`

Light-based Spirit spells are capable of weakening and dispelling **Void-based maledictions**.

**Alignment:** Spirit magic resonates with good — all Void mages and their demonic servitors are particularly vulnerable to Spirit.

---

### Void Scholar

> *"A master of negative energies who makes pacts with demons, causing death, disease, poison, and plague — even raising the dead."*

The magics of **Void** were born of the **shuddeni** and their master, **Tzet-Askhari**, and became the binding thread that held their fragile, volatile society together. In the centuries before contact with other races, this power determined who directed shuddeni lives.

Human scholars, following infamous pioneers like the **Lilunite Archmage Kaagn**, descended into the dark underworld in search of greater power. As the War of Night shrouded the world, the races of the Prime learned to fear the might of the Dragon; in turn, the aelin took to the study of demonkind, following the direction of their god, Serachel. Even the srryn, by way of Sitheus, found themselves taken by blood pacts and control of the dead. These various threads were woven together into the modern studies of the Void scholar.

**Alignment restriction:** Void magic resonates with Lawful and Evil — all good-aligned characters and those of chaotic ethos may NOT study Void. This is one of the most significant alignment restrictions in the game.

**Recommended for:** Experienced players only — Void is considered a difficult and demanding path.

**Races:** Shuddeni are the most notorious students of the Void, but humans, aelin, nefortu, caladaran, and ethron have all found themselves linked to its study.

**Patron deities:** **Ashur** (ultimate source), **Serachel**, **Lilune**, **Sitheus**

### Void Scholar Greater Paths:

**The Riven Veil (Summoner):**
> *"Masters the art of creating pacts with demonkind; able to conjure the mightiest of dark lords to the Prime Material."*

The Riven Veil's studies focus on symbols of power used to conjure demons from specific locations beyond the **Silver Veil**. These summoners are able to bring forth the mightiest of dark lords and ravage any who oppose them.

**Necromancer:**
> *"Instead of summoning demons, necromancers bring forth fiends from corpses."*

Necromancers use symbols of power to heighten the strength and attributes of their abominations. By becoming **revenants**, they gain nigh-everlasting unlife.

**Malefactor:**
> *"Cuts symbols of power into themselves, and swears their undying soul to demonic patrons."*

The malefactor learns to cut symbols of power into themselves, swearing their undying soul to demonic patrons who, in turn, grant the scholar vast power to dominate foes.

---

## Templars (Warrior-Mage Hybrids)

Templars are hybrid warrior-mage classes tied to specific elemental spheres. They blend martial combat with elemental magic, creating versatile fighters with distinct magical capabilities.

---

### Air Templar

> *"Air templars blend the magics of flight and illusion with swordsmanship and archery."*

Misdirection and evasion combine with deadly skill to give the Air Templar an edge. As Air is a force of chaos, **no lawful person may take up the sphere as a profession**.

**Capabilities:**
- Flight and aerial combat
- Illusion magic
- Archery combined with wind magic

---

### Fire Templar

Fire Templars are among the most physically-oriented of the templar classes. Unique amongst the spheres, Fire Templars predate their scholarly brethren — some of the earliest post-Sundering magic wielders were Fire Templars.

> *"One of the earliest delvings into magic after the Sundering, the srryn applied what magical capabilities they had in a characteristically brutal fashion."*

Fire Templars focus much of their magic on increasing the sheer force of their blows, without heed for their own physical state. Some of their magic is destructive in its own right, striking with devastating power.

---

### Spirit Templar

Spirit Templars wield the protective and purifying power of Spirit magic in martial form.

**Unique capabilities:**
- **Exorcism** — May exorcise demons and haunting spirits from both people and items
- **Purge** — May attempt to purge a Void Templar's bound demons from equipment or the possessing demon from the templar himself
- Strong anti-Void capabilities

---

### Void Templar

> *"A fusion of both dark magics and martial force."*

First rising to prominence during the **War of Night**, Void Templars are the darkest of the templar paths. Because of its shuddeni roots, shuddeni are the primary dedicants of this profession. However, it also has a substantial following amongst the aelin, forming the origin of the famously diabolic **ginta**.

**Signature ability — Demonbound Weapons:**
A Void Templar's signature is the use of **demonbound weapons**. These nightmarish rites allow the templar to infuse their arsenal with:
- Unnatural speed
- Supernatural strength
- The ability to leech life from foes

The practice of Void Templarhood has appeal to other races including humans and nefortu, giving it particular allure amongst mercenaries.

---

## Naturalists

### Ranger

Rangers are wilderness specialists, masters of survival, archery, and nature-based combat. Guildmaster **Adwin Feridur** suggests forests for students to visit to learn their 30+ skills.

**Capabilities:**
- Archery and ranged combat
- Wilderness survival
- Nature tracking and scouting

---

### Druid

> *"A priest of the moon, of the earth, of the sun, and of life — the druid draws upon the elemental powers inherent in nature."*

Druids are the oldest of Avendarian spellcasters. Unlike arcanists who act as a conduit for the powers of their sphere, a druid **borrows from the natural world that which is in abundance**. They embody attunement to the primal world in all its facets.

The **ethron** were the first to compose druidic orders, charged as they were by **Elar the All-Mother** to defend Her creation.

**Capabilities:**
- Nature-based magic borrowing from all elemental spheres
- Healing and growth magic
- Animal and plant communication
- A complex, bias-based **alchemical system**

---

## Rogues

### Assassin

> *"A killer, sometimes silent, sometimes swift and brutal — the assassin is always effective at the art of death."*

Assassins are proficient in a variety of weapons, but are particularly adept in **unarmed combat**. The art of death is what binds the brotherhood of the assassin.

The assassin class developed from a unique blend of **caladaran monastic living** and deadly skill. The shuddeni, despite not being the first to take to assassinry, have left an indelible mark on the business of death due to their vast knowledge and cruel lusts.

---

## Other Classes

### Psionicist

> *"Devotees of the mind, the psionicists are dedicated to tapping their own inherent mental power."*

Psychic manifestation has historically been exceedingly rare outside the confines of the **caladaran** race. With their arrival in the Earendam river basin, they shared tales of **Jalassa**, the goddess to whom they credited the revelation of their unusual power: psionics.

**Alignment restriction:**
- May be any alignment (good/neutral/evil)
- May only be **lawful or neutral ethos** — chaotic individuals lack the discipline required to control mind and body to the required degree
- **Ch'taren cannot study psionics** despite their immense intelligence — they are too inherently chaotic

**Weapon preference:** Psionicists often choose to wield a **staff or spear**, using them to great effect in conjunction with their arsenal of mental powers.

**Notable features:**
- A novel system of **psionic foci** (not standard spells or skills)
- Heavy emphasis on mental discipline and control
- Gravitate toward **Jalassa** as patron deity
- Spells that require multiple casters to complete

**Races:** Cannot be played by races with limited mental capacity. Ch'taren are excluded despite their intelligence.

---

### Bard

The Bard is one of the uncategorized classes in Avendar. Bards wield a sweeping array of songs that can be **surprisingly effective** in combat and social situations. Their array of songs can affect allies and enemies alike, making them unique utility and support characters.

---

## Summoning and Binding

Several classes feature unique summoning mechanics:

- **Void Scholar (Riven Veil)** — Summons demons through hermetic rituals by piercing the Silver Veil
- **Void Templar** — Binds demons into weapons through demonbound rites
- **Drake Raiser** — Some classes can **raise drakes from hatchlings** as companions and combat allies

---

## Skill Types

Skills in Avendar come in several distinct types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Abilities** | General competencies and passive capabilities |
| **Spells** | Magical castings from the elemental spheres |
| **Foci** | Psionic mental powers (psionicist-specific) |
| **Forms** | Combat stances and fighting styles |
| **Songs** | Musical abilities (bard-specific) |

Most skills can be trained by spending a **practice** at an appropriate NPC, usually a guildmaster for class-related skills.
