# Traits

Traits are optional background characteristics selected during character creation that provide lasting mechanical benefits. They represent innate talents, life experiences, and natural aptitudes that distinguish one character from another of the same class and race.

## Overview

Traits are purchased with points during character creation. Each trait belongs to one of four groups and has a point cost. The two cost values represent different cost tiers (e.g., the cost may vary based on character type or available point pools).

Traits are permanent — once selected at character creation, they cannot be changed.

| **Background** | tgBG | Life history and upbringing |

## Notes

- Traits with a cost of 0 (Special Traits above) are typically granted through gameplay, not selected at creation.
- The **Heirloom** and **Loyal Retainer** traits have the highest costs (3–4), reflecting their significant mechanical impact.
- **Cowardly** is a negative-connotation trait that still provides a mechanical benefit (better fleeing).
- Traits interact with Avendar's roleplay culture — selecting *Aristocrat* or *Streetwise* carries expectations about your character's background that should inform your roleplay.
