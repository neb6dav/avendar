# Avendar: Character Creation

Creating a character in Avendar involves choosing your race, class, alignment, ethos, and deity — all of which are deeply intertwined with the game's lore and mechanics.

---

## The School of Heroes

All player characters are adventurers who have graduated from the **School of Heroes**. This in-game institution serves as the tutorial area and lore repository for new players.

> *"The School of Heroes accepts those of any background — from simple farmboys to Harrudim princesses."*

- Avendar places no restrictions on the types of in-setting roles a player can pursue
- You can play a member of a royal family, an Earendamian noble, the relative of a famous NPC, an aspiring priest of a god, etc.
- Your character concept must fit and make sense within the setting, lore, and genre of Avendar
- You may be a figure of destiny whispered of by Kyanans, or an impoverished soul that decided to write their own legend

### Required Reading: The Races of Avendar

The School of Heroes contains *The Races of Avendar* by **Antaerus the Elder, Scribe of Earendam** — an in-game text covering each race in detail. This is essential reading for any new player.

---

## Character Concept

Your character concept must:
- Fit and make sense within the setting, lore, and genre of Avendar
- Be consistent with your chosen race's history and culture
- Be consistent with your chosen alignment and ethos
- Not violate race-specific restrictions (e.g., shuddeni cannot be good-aligned)

Characters may originate from any in-world background as long as it is plausible within the setting.

## The Six Stats

Your character is made up of **six different stats** that each affect your abilities in different ways:

### Strength (STR)
Measures muscle and physical power.
- Important for characters who engage in melee (hand-to-hand) combat
- Determines the **maximum amount of weight** your character can carry
- Higher strength means harder hits in physical combat

### Intelligence (INT)
A measure of a character's problem-solving ability.
- Controls a character's ability to comprehend **foreign languages**
- Governs skill in **magic** and spellcasting effectiveness
- In some cases, controls how many skill points are gained at level up
- Critical for scholars and other magic-using classes

### Wisdom (WIS)
A measure of common sense and/or spirituality.
- Controls the ability to cast certain spells
- Governs communication with mystical entities
- Helps discern other characters' motives or feelings
- Important for clerical and nature-based magical paths

### Dexterity (DEX)
A measure of agility.
- Controls **attack speed** and **movement speed**
- Affects **accuracy** of attacks
- Affects **evasion** — how well you avoid an opponent's attacks
- Important for rogues, archers, and agile classes

### Constitution (CON)
Measures health, stamina, and vital force.
- Represents **physical resilience** — how well you can take a hit
- If Strength determines how hard you hit and Dexterity how well you avoid being hit, Constitution is how much punishment you can absorb
- Higher constitution means more hit points

### Charisma (CHA)
A measure of social skills and sometimes physical appearance.
- Generally influences **prices while trading** with merchants
- Affects **NPC reactions** to your character
- Social and diplomatic applications

## Race Selection

Race affects your base stat distribution and racial traits:

| Race | Strengths | Weaknesses | Special |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Alatharya** | Strength, Constitution | Cannot use powerful magic | Patron: Enirra |
| **Aelin** | Intelligence, Dexterity | Vulnerable to blunt/Earth | Natural flight; lightning resistance |
| **Caladaran** | Intelligence, Wisdom | Physical frailty | Access to psionics |
| **Ch'taren** | Intelligence, Spirit affinity | Cannot study psionics; must be Good | Natural spirit resistance |
| **Chaja** | Constitution, cold resistance | N/A | Subterranean origin |
| **Ethron** | Wisdom, nature affinity | N/A | Patron triad: Elar, Nariel, Lielqan |
| **Human** | Balanced | No special resistances | Widest class access |
| **Kankoran** | Strength, cold resistance | Vulnerable to fire | Pack mentality |
| **Nefortu** | Dexterity, Charisma | N/A | Natural flight |
| **Shuddeni** | Intelligence, Void affinity | Cannot use Water magic; must be Evil | Subterranean; eyeless |
| **Srryn** | Strength, fire resistance | Vulnerable to cold | Saurian; fire magic history |

---

## Class Selection

At creation you choose your class, which determines your available skills, spells, and progression path. Avendar features up to **sixty playable classes**.

### Scholar Specialization

Scholars have an additional choice at creation: their **sphere(s)**. You choose:
1. A **major sphere** (your primary element)
2. Optionally, a **minor sphere** (for mixed-sphere play)

Choosing the same sphere twice makes you a **Greater Scholar** of that element, unlocking the most powerful greater-path spells. Choosing two different spheres creates a **mixed-sphere** scholar with access to unique combination abilities.

**Available spheres:** Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Spirit, Void

**Alignment restrictions:**
- Void scholars must be Lawful Evil (cannot be Good or Chaotic)
- Air scholars cannot be Lawful ethos

---

## Alignment and Ethos Selection

At creation, you choose both your **alignment** (Good/Neutral/Evil) and **ethos** (Lawful/Neutral/Chaotic).

### Racial Restrictions
- **Ch'taren:** Must be Good
- **Shuddeni:** Must be Evil

### Class Restrictions
- **Void scholars/templars:** Must be Lawful Evil
- **Air scholars/templars:** Cannot be Lawful ethos
- **Psionicists:** Can be any alignment but must be Lawful or Neutral ethos

### Interaction with Magic
Your alignment choice directly affects what magic is available to you — particularly the Spirit/Void axis of elemental spheres.

---

## Deity Selection

Characters in Avendar can worship one of the game's many deities, which affects:
- Available religious abilities and quests
- Faction membership eligibility
- Roleplay options and NPC interactions

Most races have a natural affinity for their racial deities, but characters are not restricted to worshipping their racial pantheon.

---

## Character Lifespan

Player characters in Avendar have a **finite lifespan**:
- No player character should remain in active play for longer than approximately **one and a half years** of real-life time
- This limit can be reached by **running out of deaths** (each character has a limited number of lives)
- Characters also have a **maximum age** beyond which they cannot survive
- When a character reaches the end of their lifespan, it opens the world to new stories and prevents any single character from permanently dominating

This design philosophy ensures the world is always changing and new players can catch up with returning characters.

---

## Viable vs. Challenging Combinations

The Newbie Guide notes that some class and race combinations may be more challenging than others, but they are **all viable** — with **three exceptions** (not specified in available documentation).

The game encourages players to create characters according to their whim, as even challenging combinations can be played successfully.

---

## Getting Started

After character creation, you emerge from the **School of Heroes** ready to adventure. Key early advice:
- Visit your class's **guildmaster** to practice skills and learn your trade
- Consult the **help system** (type `help <topic>` in-game) for information on any topic
- Pay attention to "See Also" sections at the bottom of helpfiles — they point to other useful information
- For rangers, **Adwin Feridur** will suggest forests to visit to learn your skills
