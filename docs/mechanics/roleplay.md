# Avendar: Roleplay Guidelines and Systems

Roleplaying is a **mandatory requirement** in Avendar. This is not merely encouraged — it is enforced. The game is classified as an **RP+/PvP+ MUD**, where roleplay and player-vs-player combat are both central pillars.

---

## The Roleplay Requirement

> *"Any time you are logged in, you are expected to remain in-character and respond to things as a character within the setting of Avendar would."*

Key principles:
- **Always in-character** — Your character is always "on stage" when logged in
- **Communication logging** — Any time you are logged into Avendar, you consent to your communications being logged and potentially read by staff
- **OOC channel** — All communication should be in-character **unless** using the designated OOC (Out of Character) chat channel

---

## Character Concepts

Your character concept must fit and make sense within:
- The **setting** of Avendar (the world, its history, its geography)
- The **lore** (racial histories, divine relationships, major events)
- The **genre** (original high fantasy, not generic tropes)

All player characters are adventurers who have graduated from the **School of Heroes**. This provides a common starting point for all characters regardless of background.

### Background Freedom

Avendar places no restrictions on the types of in-setting roles a player can pursue:
- A member of a royal family
- An Earendamian noble
- A relative of a famous NPC
- An aspiring priest of a god
- A figure of destiny whispered of by Kyanans
- An impoverished soul who decided to write their own legend

Your character may be **as exceptional or as ordinary** as you wish, within reason.

## Communication Systems

Communication is the most essential part of interactions in Avendar. Players may communicate in several ways:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Say** | In-character speech to the room |
| **Tell** | Private in-character message to another player |
| **OOC** | Out-of-character communication channel |
| **Emotes** | Physical descriptions of character actions |
| **Notes** | Written in-character messages to other PCs, NPCs, or gods |

Being **asleep** will block most communication channels, barring the use of certain skills or traits.

## Storylines and Engagement

Storylines are run by staff for the benefit of both players and staff. They require dedicated staff time and often involve receiving in-character mechanical rewards.

### What Counts as Engagement

Players are expected to reciprocate through active engagement with the game and story. Valid engagement includes:

- **Interacting with other PCs** (cooperatively or antagonistically)
- **Interacting with an NPC** actively being played by a staff member
- **Interactions involving Avendar's setting and themes**
- **Undertaking mechanical challenges** with other players
- **Writing thoughtful notes** to other PCs, NPCs, or gods

### What Does NOT Count as Engagement

- **Solo emoting/speeches** not directed at or observed by other characters
- **Interactions with NPCs** not being played by a staff member at that time

---

## Deity Interaction

Gods are **ubiquitous in Avendar** and intervene regularly in the lives of mortals to the degree the Compact allows.

### God Touch

Even the casual, passing attention of a divinity can leave a mark on a person's soul that manifests on their body — known as a **god touch**. This serves as a permanent marker of divine notice and can be a significant roleplay element.

### Divine Communication

Players can:
- Write **notes to gods** as part of prayer and petition
- Receive **in-character responses** from staff playing active deities
- Be involved in **divine storylines** that have lasting world consequences

---

## Roleplay and PvP

Despite requiring strong roleplay, Avendar fully integrates PvP as a roleplay tool:

> *"Unlike some other MUDs where PK is discouraged, Avendar uses inter-character combat as a method for in-game conflict resolution as well as an enhancement to roleplay."*

PvP conflict should:
- Arise from genuine in-character conflict
- Be consistent with your character's alignment, faction, and motivations
- Be pursued with roleplay context, not purely for mechanical advantage

The balance of player-driven conflict and staff-enforced roleplaying has kept Avendar active for over 25 years.

---

## The Roleplay Ecosystem

### Houses as Roleplay Structures

The Great Houses provide an **organized roleplay framework**:
- Each House has a distinct ideology and roleplay style
- House conflicts create natural in-character tensions
- House membership provides community and story hooks

### Religion as Roleplay

Each deity has associated roleplay styles, obligations, and community:
- Detailed pantheon of **30+ gods and demigods**, all culturally linked to the races they represent
- Sample roles available in their various sects
- Religious conflict drives significant in-character drama

### Permanent Consequences

Perhaps the most striking aspect of Avendar's roleplay is that events have **permanent consequences**:
- Characters have finite lifespans
- World events can permanently alter the game world
- Complex, multi-generational storylines have potentially permanent effects on the setting

---

## Character Death and Continuity

### The Finite Lifespan

> *"It is intended that no player character remain in active play for longer than about a year and a half of real-life time."*

This design:
- Ensures regular character turnover
- Prevents any single character from permanently dominating
- Allows new players to catch up
- Keeps the world's story moving forward

### Legacy and Memory

When a character's story ends, it becomes part of Avendar's living history. Famous characters may be remembered in the world's lore, referenced by NPCs, or influence future storylines.

## Getting Into Character

Useful considerations for establishing roleplay in Avendar:

1. **Know your race's history** — The racial histories are deep and interconnected; knowing yours helps you roleplay authentically
2. **Choose your deity carefully** — Your patron god shapes your character's worldview and obligations
3. **Consider your alignment** — Good, neutral, and evil alignments have real behavioral implications
4. **Engage with the setting** — Avendar's world is rich; reference its history, cities, and figures in your roleplay
5. **Write notes** — Notes to other characters and gods are among the most powerful roleplay tools available
6. **Participate in storylines** — Staff-run events are opportunities to affect the world permanently
