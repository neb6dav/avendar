# Avendar: Houses, Factions, and the Stones of Power

One of Avendar's defining features is its **Great Houses** system — organized factions that fight ideological wars over the control of the world's most powerful artifacts.

---

## Overview

> *"Players can adventure and compete alongside others in the great Houses, fighting ideological wars over the control of ten Stones of Power."*

Players in Avendar can:
- Join one of the established Great Houses
- Pursue House-based quests and PvP conflicts
- Fight for control of the **Stones of Power**
- Alternatively, distance themselves from society and amass personal wealth to build their own house, tavern, or even a keep

---

## The Stones of Power

The **ten Stones of Power** are mystical artifacts scattered across the world of Avendar. These legendary items are the ultimate prize in the ongoing factional wars between the Great Houses.

- Each stone represents immense power
- Control of the stones grants significant benefits to the House that holds them
- Houses engage in both PvP combat and strategic maneuvering to hold and contest these artifacts
- The stones create a persistent, world-shaping conflict that drives the game's ongoing story

## The Great Houses

### Champions of Avendar (Champions of Light)

**Alignment:** Good
**Patron Deities:** Rystaia (Lightbringer), Aeolis, Jolinn

The Champions of Avendar stand as defenders against the forces of darkness. They are the organized force of Good in the world, dedicated to protecting the innocent, opposing evil, and upholding the light.

**Key characteristics:**
- Most natural home for ch'taren and other Good-aligned characters
- Engage in direct conflict against the Shunned and other evil houses
- Supported by the divine sanction of major Good deities
- The Rystaia religion is well-tolerated even in Earendam due to Champions' prominence

**Roleplay focus:** Active opposition to evil, protection of the innocent, pursuit of freedom from tyranny (following Rystaia's example).

---

### Guardians of the Law

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral to Lawful Good
**Philosophy:** Order as the foundation of civilization

The Guardians protect cities from unlawful forces and maintain the rule of law in Avendar's city-states. They represent the organized enforcement of civilization's rules, often aligned with **Iandir's** portfolio of natural order.

**Notable history:**
- The first Patrician of Earendam, **Corvandil Lyceonis**, is revered as a Saint among the Brotherhood for his legendary defense of the city during the First Kankoran War

**Key characteristics:**
- Lawful characters feel most at home here
- Focused on civic duty and the protection of established order
- Often found working within city governance structures
- May conflict with more chaotic-aligned characters even if both are nominally good

**Roleplay focus:** Upholding law, protecting citizens, organized response to criminal or military threats.

---

### Raiders of Twilight

**Alignment:** Variable — often chaotic or neutral
**Philosophy:** Twilight — neither pure light nor pure darkness

The Raiders of Twilight occupy a morally ambiguous space between the forces of Light and Dark. They are not bound by the strict codes of the Champions or the Guardians, but neither do they serve the darkness directly.

**Key characteristics:**
- Appeal to morally complex characters
- More flexible alignment requirements than the polar extremes
- Engage in both PvP and exploration/raiding gameplay

**Roleplay focus:** Personal power, exploration, and conflict on one's own terms.

---

### The Shunned (Coven of the Shunned)

**Alignment:** Evil
**Patron Deity:** Serachel (Lord of the Fallen)

The Coven of the Shunned operates in the shadows, working the will of **Serachel** through mortal hands. They represent organized evil in Avendar — plotting, scheming, and working toward the eventual return of the Dark Angel.

> *"Serachel stands high as a god of darkness, as His intrigues and successes outmatch many of His deific brethren. As patron of the Coven of the Shunned, Serachel's will is wrought through far more mortal hands than many of His evil counterparts."*

**Key characteristics:**
- Serachel's primary mortal organization
- Shuddeni and evil aelin are common members
- Engage in scheming, infiltration, and direct PvP against the Champions
- Hated by Good-aligned characters

**Roleplay focus:** Accumulating power, furthering Serachel's agenda, corruption and manipulation.

---

### Followers of Dolgrael

**Alignment:** Neutral (Honor-based)
**Patron Deity:** Dolgrael
**Philosophy:** "Soldiers of honor in all things"

Dolgrael's followers represent a martial tradition focused on honor in combat — neither strictly good nor evil, but bound by a code of combat ethics.

**Key characteristics:**
- Warriors and combat specialists
- Honor-focused rather than alignment-focused
- Unique position outside the Good/Evil divide

**Roleplay focus:** Honorable combat, martial excellence, personal codes of conduct.

---

## House Powers

Some houses have access to **house powers** — special abilities or bonuses granted to House members. These are reflected in the game code (`house_powers.c`) and represent the divine and organizational backing of their patron deities.

House powers may include:
- Special combat abilities
- Enhanced skills or spells
- Access to restricted areas or NPCs
- Unique equipment or boons

---

## Faction Dynamics

The faction system is described as "a very interesting RP-promoting tool, making players think about choosing sides." The key dynamics:

- **Good vs. Evil** — Champions and Guardians vs. the Shunned and evil houses
- **Law vs. Chaos** — Guardians vs. Raiders and chaotic factions
- **Neutral interests** — Raiders and Dolgrael's followers can shift the balance

House conflicts play out through:
1. **PvP combat** — Direct player-vs-player fighting over territories and Stones
2. **Strategic stone control** — Holding and contesting the ten Stones of Power
3. **Roleplaying** — In-character political maneuvering, espionage, and alliance-building
4. **Divine backing** — Patron deities can influence house conflicts through the limits of the Compact

---

## Building Your Own House

Players who accumulate sufficient wealth and prestige can potentially establish their own **personal holdings**:
- **Personal houses** — Private residences
- **Taverns** — Commercial establishments
- **Keeps** — Fortified strongholds

This system allows highly successful characters to leave a permanent mark on Avendar's landscape, outside the formal Great House structure.

---

## Religion as Faction

Beyond the Great Houses, **religion** serves as a secondary faction system:
- Characters can join a deity's **cult or following** (formally or informally)
- Religious factions often conflict or cooperate independently of House allegiance
- A follower of Rystaia and a follower of Serachel will naturally be at odds regardless of House membership
- Priests and devoted worshippers can access deity-specific abilities and quests

Notable religious factions include:
- **The Saurian Sept** (Sythrak)
- **The Swamplords** (Sythrak)
- **The Reptile Shamans** (Sythrak)
- **The Apotechta** (Enirra)
- **The Brotherhood** (Jolinn/Earendam traditions)
