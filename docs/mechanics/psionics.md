# Psionics

Psionics is a mental discipline practiced by the **Psionicist** class. Rather than drawing on elemental magic or divine power, psionicists use pure mental force to perceive, influence, and harm others. Psionic abilities are called **foci** — concentration-maintained mental states that require no component or words to activate.

## Overview

Psionics in Avendar operates differently from other magic systems:

- **No verbal or somatic components** — foci are activated through pure mental will
- **Sustained effects** — most psionic abilities are maintained states (foci), not one-shot spells
- **Focus slots** — psionicists have a limited number of foci they can maintain simultaneously
- **Mental resistance** — targets may resist psionic effects depending on their mental fortitude
- **No Weave interaction** — psionics bypasses the elemental Weave entirely, making psionicists uniquely dangerous in areas where magic is disrupted

## Focus Slots

A psionicist has a finite number of **focus slots** that determines how many psionic abilities they can maintain at once. Slot count scales with level and Intelligence. When all slots are occupied, the psionicist must drop an existing focus before establishing a new one.

## Roleplaying Psionics

Psionicists in Avendar exist outside the traditional magical frameworks. They are often viewed with unease by scholars of the Weave, since their power operates by entirely different principles. The **Shuddeni** race has a racial affinity for psionics, though the class is open to other races as well.

Psionicist characters must grapple with the ethical weight of their abilities — the capacity to read thoughts, dominate minds, and manipulate memories raises significant questions about consent and identity in Avendar's roleplay-heavy culture.
