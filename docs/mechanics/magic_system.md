# Avendar: The Magic System

Magic in Avendar was fragmented from its pure form during **the Sundering** — when the alatharya attempted to steal divine power and were punished by the combined wrath of the Overgods. What was once a unified divine force was shattered into **six elemental spheres**.

---

## The Six Elemental Spheres

There are six major elements that affect the entire workings of the world: **Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit, Void, and Water**. Races suffer from vulnerabilities to them, quests are based on mastery of them, and equipment is imbued with them.

| Sphere | Alignment Tendency | Primary Theme |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Air** | Chaotic | Wind, lightning, illusion, flight |
| **Earth** | Neutral | Stone, metal, magnetism, solidity |
| **Fire** | Neutral-Evil | Destruction, heat, magma, war |
| **Water** | Neutral-Good | Healing, ice, cold, the ocean |
| **Spirit** | Good | Life, the Weave, holy power, exorcism |
| **Void** | Lawful Evil | Death, demons, undeath, negative energy |

### The Moral Axis of Magic

The most significant moral divide in Avendar's magic system:
- **Spirit** — The magic of light, life, and the Weave. Opposed to Void. Good-aligned.
- **Void** — The magic of death, demons, and destruction. Opposed to Spirit. Lawful Evil.

Characters who wish to pursue a morally committed magical path must choose either Spirit (good) or Void (evil). Void is recommended for **experienced players only** due to its complexity and the player skill required.

## Scholar Specialization

### Major and Minor Spheres

Scholars select a **major sphere** (primary focus) and optionally a **minor sphere** (secondary study):

- **Greater Scholar** — Chooses the same sphere twice at creation; gains access to the most powerful "greater path" spells of that sphere
- **Mixed-Sphere Scholar** — Combines a major and a minor sphere; gains access to unique mixed-sphere abilities and greater versatility

### Mixed-Sphere Combinations and Effects

Different sphere combinations produce unique magical effects:

| Combination | Mixed-Sphere Effect |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Fire + Earth | Lava spells and geothermal magic |
| Fire + Air | Fire-storm combinations |
| Fire + Water | Steam and thermal magic |
| Fire + Spirit | Holy fire, purifying flame |
| Fire + Void | Dark fire, corruption |
| Earth + Air | Dust, sand, and stone-wind |
| Earth + Void | Necromantic earth, bone |
| Water + Air | Storm and mist magic |
| Water + Void | Corrupted water, blight |
| Spirit + Air | Aerial holy magic |
| Spirit + Earth | Sacred stone, grounding |
| Spirit + Water | Sacred water, purification |
| Spirit + Void | Paradoxical; extremely rare |
| Air + Void | Shadowy wind, silence |

All scholars that study a given sphere are admitted into that sphere's guilds. All mixed-sphere scholars can enter and practice at both their major and minor guilds as they choose.

## Spheres and Alignment Restrictions

### Alignment-Locked Spheres

**Void Magic** (Evil):
- Cannot be studied by **good-aligned** characters
- Cannot be studied by **chaotic ethos** characters
- Resonates with Lawful and Evil

**Air Magic** (Chaotic):
- Cannot be studied by **lawful ethos** characters
- As Air is a force of chaos, no lawful person may take up the sphere as a profession

**Spirit Magic** (Good):
- No explicit restriction, but its power is greatest against evil-aligned targets
- Void-based curses and maledictions can be dispelled by Spirit magic

---

## The Weave vs. The Void

A fundamental metaphysical opposition runs through Avendar's cosmology:

**The Weave:**
> *"Spirit magic concerns itself with the Weave, the flow of life Jolinn produced from primal chaos."*

The Weave is the interconnected flow of all living things — the essence of Jolinn's creation. Spirit magic works with the Weave, healing, protecting, and amplifying life.

**The Void:**
> *"The magics of the Void were born of the shuddeni and their master, Tzet-Askhari."*

The Void is the negation of life — the domain of Ashur the Dragon of Death. Void magic disrupts the Weave, bringing death, corruption, and demonic power.

Light-based Spirit spells are specifically capable of **weakening and dispelling Void-based maledictions**.

---

## The Silver Veil

The **Silver Veil** is the planar barrier between the Prime Material and the demonic planes. Void scholars — particularly those of the **Riven Veil** greater path — pierce the Silver Veil to summon demons directly to the Prime Material.

The summoning of demons through the Silver Veil is conducted through **symbols of power** and **hermetic rituals** — careful preparations that determine what kind of demon is summoned and the terms under which it operates.

---

## Demonic Binding

Void Templars use a related but distinct system called **demonbound weapons**:
- Nightmarish rites infuse weapons with demonic essence
- Can grant weapons unnatural speed, supernatural strength, or life-leeching ability
- Spirit Templars can **purge** demonbound weapons through exorcism

---

## How Magic Works in Practice

### Concentration

A concentration skill was added for scholars and druids to check if spells succeed in battle:
- Spellcasting no longer fails concentration when **outside of combat**
- When concentration fails, the skill itself improves (learning through failure)
- The "battlecaster" trait (formerly "armored caster") allows templars to automatically pass concentration checks
- Individual spell percents now improve or strengthen effective caster level when cast

### The Lag System

Avendar uses a **lag** system rather than a countdown timer. When casting a spell:
- There will be a delay before the next command can be executed
- Multiple commands may be queued while lagged; they execute in order
- Different spells and abilities create different amounts of lag

### Mana

Spells consume **mana** (magical energy). Some abilities also have mana costs that were previously free:
- Shield bash now has a mana cost
- Bash now has a mana cost
- Both now follow the general rules of melee combat

### Spell Failure and Learning

Skills and spells can be **practiced** at guild NPCs using the practice system. As you use skills, they improve over time. Failing a concentration check on a spell still causes the concentration skill to improve.

## Racial Magic Affinities

Each race has elemental affinities reflecting their history and divine patronage:

| Race | Resistance | Vulnerability | Magic Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Aelin | Lightning | Blunt/Earth | Wings from Alil; Serachel brought Void to them |
| Shuddeni | Void | Water/Holy | Cannot command Water magic at all |
| Srryn | Fire | Ice/Cold | Fire magic predates their scholars |
| Kankoran | Cold | Fire | Northern ancestry |
| Alatharya | Various | None | Magic stripped but raw power remains |
| Ch'taren | Spirit/Holy | Void | Brought Spirit magic to Avendar |

---

## Elemental Equipment

Equipment throughout Avendar is often imbued with elemental power. The six spheres can be found on:
- Weapons (dealing elemental damage types)
- Armor (providing elemental resistances or vulnerabilities)
- Jewelry and accessories (boosting elemental spellcasting)

Exceptional items are often **limited** — only so many copies may exist in the game world at any time. Particularly exceptional or legendary items will typically be **limit 1**, while powerful but less rare items may have higher limits.
