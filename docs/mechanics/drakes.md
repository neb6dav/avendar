# Drakes

Drakes are stone-born companion creatures unique to earth elementalists. They are awakened from the elemental plane of earth and grow alongside their master, gaining power over time.

---

## Overview

Drakes are summoned through the **Wakened Stone** skill, available to earth scholars (Geomancers and their advanced paths). Rather than a conventional pet, drakes are living stone constructs whose type, resistances, and abilities are determined by the material composition of the area where they are awakened.

To awaken a drake, you must:
1. Have an earth elemental as your pet
2. Be standing on solid ground
3. Have sufficient mana and skill in Wakened Stone
4. Cast the skill, targeting your earth elemental

On success, the elemental is consumed and a drake hatchling emerges in its place, shaped by the stone of the land.

## Drake Ages

Drakes mature through seven age stages over time. Each stage brings increased stats, new specials, and greater combat effectiveness.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hatchling** | Tiny, no wings, pale stone flesh. Just born. |
| **Youngling** | Wing stubs emerging, stone deepening in color. |
| **Fledgling** | Nearly adult, nearly full wings, deeper hue. |
| **Wingborne** | Full-grown adult, fanged, clawed, armored. |
| **Greater** | Larger than normal, pronounced fangs and wings. |
| **Elder** | Thick spiked plates, dark focused eyes. |
| **Ancient** | Maximum stage. Massive, fused plate armor, lethal. |

Maturation time is determined by the stone type — some stones mature faster or slower than average. Time between stages scales with the age level (later stages take longer).

## Conduit of Stonesong

Some advanced earth scholars can learn **Conduit of Stonesong**, an ability that benefits their drake while it is in the same room. A drake whose master has this buff active is considered to "have stonesong," which may enhance certain drake specials.
