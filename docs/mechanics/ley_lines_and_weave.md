# Ley Lines and the Weave

The **Weave** is the invisible network of magical energy that permeates Avendar. It is the medium through which elemental scholars cast their spells, and its presence or absence in a location fundamentally shapes what is magically possible there.

---

## Overview

The Weave consists of **ley lines** — channels of elemental power that flow through the world, connecting areas of magical concentration. Where ley lines intersect or terminate, **founts** of power form: focal points of great magical density.

Unlike many fantasy settings, Avendar's Weave is dynamic: it regenerates over time, routes around disruptions, and can be attuned to by those with the sensitivity to perceive it.

## Ley Lines

Ley lines are strands of elemental energy that flow between rooms, following geographical and elemental logic. Each ley line has:

- **Direction** — it flows from one room toward an adjacent room
- **Length** — lines extend a minimum of 3 rooms and average about 12
- **Order Power** — a measure of how structured and stable the line is
- **Positive Power** — a measure of the beneficial or harmful elemental charge

### Perceiving Ley Lines

Spellcasters attuned to the Weave can perceive ley lines in their current room using the appropriate detection ability. A ley line in a room manifests as a visible thread of elemental force trailing off in one or more directions.

### Ley Line Descriptions

A ley line in a room is described based on its two power values:

**Order Power** (structure):
- Highly ordered lines feel ancient, regular, and geometrically precise
- Chaotic lines feel frantic, irregular, and difficult to channel

**Positive Power** (charge):
- High positive power: benevolent, life-giving, healing-oriented
- Negative power: draining, corrupting, destructive

The combination produces unique descriptions — a line might be "a trembling thread of chaotic darkness" or "a steady band of golden light."

## Founts

A **fount** is a focal point where ley line power concentrates — the beginning or end of one or more ley lines. Founts are the most magically potent locations in Avendar and are highly sought after by scholars.

Properties of founts:
- Higher ambient mana regeneration for attuned casters
- Stronger resonance with elemental sphere magic
- Can be detected by multiple sensory skills
- Generated and consumed through natural Weave regeneration

The description of a fount reflects the combined order and positive power of all lines converging on it.

## The Regeneration Cycle

The Weave is not static — it regenerates periodically. During regeneration:

1. **Existing founts** may be rerouted or removed as the Weave shifts
2. **New founts** are created in areas with sufficient magical density
3. **Ley lines** are generated outward from founts, propagating through adjacent rooms
4. **Area modifiers** adjust the power and character of lines based on location

This means a fount discovered in one session may have shifted or vanished by the next. Experienced scholars learn to attune quickly and not rely on static locations.

---

## Attunement

Spellcasters can become **attuned** to the Weave through proximity to ley lines and founts. Attunement represents the depth of one's connection to the active magical network in an area.

Benefits of attunement:
- Improved mana regeneration
- Reduced casting costs (in some cases)
- Greater sensitivity to magical phenomena
- Enhanced power for sphere-appropriate spells

Attunements update automatically as the Weave regenerates. A caster who has been resting near a strong fount will be more attuned than one who just arrived.

## Order and Positive Power

The two key measurements of Weave power:

| Measurement | Low Value | High Value |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Order Power** | Chaotic, unpredictable magic | Structured, reliable magic |
| **Positive Power** | Dark, destructive, Void-aligned | Bright, life-giving, Spirit-aligned |

These values are not good or evil in themselves — a Void scholar seeks locations of negative power as eagerly as a Spirit scholar seeks positive power.

### Area Modifiers

Certain areas apply permanent modifiers to local Weave power:
- Sacred sites boost positive/order power
- Blighted or corrupted areas reduce positive power
- Ancient ruins may have unusual order characteristics
- Void-touched regions have naturally negative power

---

## The Weave and the Void

The Void exists as a counterforce to the Weave. Void sphere magic does not draw on ley lines in the same way elemental magic does — rather, it tears at the fabric of the Weave itself, using its absence or corruption as power.

In Avendar's cosmology:
- **The Weave** = the ordered structure of elemental magic
- **The Void** = the entropic force that unravels it

Locations drained of Weave power, or deliberately corrupted by Void magic, become inimical to elemental scholars but favorable to Void practitioners.

## Practical Notes for Players

- **Mages benefit from resting near founts** — the ambient power accelerates mana recovery
- **The Weave shifts periodically** — don't memorize static fount locations; learn to detect them
- **Sphere affinity matters** — a line of fire-dominant power benefits Fire scholars more than Water scholars
- **Void mages may actively disrupt** ley lines, while Earth scholars (with runes like Ground) may reinforce them
- **Detection abilities** allow you to read the local Weave; learn `sense weave` or equivalent skills
